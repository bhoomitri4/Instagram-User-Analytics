# Instagram-User-Analytics

Description:
User analysis is the process by which we track how users engage and interact with our digital product (software or mobile application) in an attempt to derive business insights for marketing, product & development teams.
These insights are then used by teams across the business to launch a new marketing campaign, decide on features to build for an app, track the success of the app by measuring user engagement and improve the experience altogether while helping the business grow.
You are working with the product team of Instagram and the product manager has asked you to provide insights on the questions asked by the management team.

OUTCOMES OF THE ANALYSIS USING SQL Queries
1)  5 oldest users of the Instagram from the database provided
2)  users who have never posted a single photo on Instagram
3)  user who gets the most likes on a single photo 
4)  Identify and suggest the top 5 most commonly used hashtags on the platform
5)  What day of the week do most users register on? Provide insights on when to schedule an ad campaign
6)  how many times does average user posts on Instagram. Also, the total number of photos on Instagram/total number of users
7)  Provide data on users (bots) who have liked every single photo on the site (since any normal user would not be able to do this).

SQL was used to do this project on an online software: db-fiddle.
The report has the queries ran alongwith the result and insights.
